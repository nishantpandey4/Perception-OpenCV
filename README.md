# Perception-OpenCV
Projects implemented using OpenCV. These projects were made for solving the assignments given in ENPM673 course of University of Maryland 
All the projects were implemented using OpenCV and numpy. 
Many assignments restricted the usage of inbuilt functions present in OpenCV and thus I implemented alot of stuff from scratch. 
Read the questions first to understand the context of the projects.
