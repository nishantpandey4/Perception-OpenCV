# Perception-OpenCV
Projects implemented using OpenCV. These projects were made for solving the assignments given in the ENPM673 course at the University of Maryland All the projects were implemented using OpenCV and numpy. 
Many assignments restricted the usage of inbuilt functions present in OpenCV and thus I implemented alot of stuff from scratch. 
Read the questions first to understand the context of the projects.
