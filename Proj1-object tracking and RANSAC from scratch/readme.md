ENPM673 â€“ Perception for Autonomous Robots
Project 1
Created by- Nishant Awdeshkumar Pandey - 119247556

Table of Contents:

-> project1_1.py - Contains the entire code for the first question 
-> project1_2.py - Contains the entire code for the second question
-> report - Detailed solution for both question
-> pc1.csv - Point cloud data provided
-> pc2.csv - point cloud data provided
-> ball.mov - Ball trajectory video provided

The entire project was coded on Visual studio code and the following libraries were used:
numpy - To install "sudo apt-install python3-numpy" in your terminal 
matplotlib - To install "sudo apt-install python3-matplotlib" in your terminal

Note:

-> Close the graph on the screen to see the other graphs one after another. After closing figures of least square methods implementation wait for few seconds to get RANSAC graph.

-> After running project1_2.py there will be a few warnings kindly ignore them, the output will not change because of them. These warnings are because during the initial computation of SVD some values might not be computable, however the iterations for RANSAC does not stop.  

-> If the codes do not work because it is unable to access either the video or the .csv files please place the code file and the .mov and .csv files in the same directory/folder.
